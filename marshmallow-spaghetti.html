              <ol>
                <li>Boil the Spaghetti: Start by bringing a large pot of
                  water to a boil. Add a pinch of salt, a splash of orange
                  juice for that zesty twist, and the spaghetti noodles. Cook
                  until the noodles are al dente.</li>
        
                <li>Prepare the Sauce: While the noodles are cooking, pour
                  the jar of spaghetti sauce into a separate pot. Add the mini
                  marshmallows and stir over medium heat until the
                  marshmallows start to melt and blend with the sauce,
                  creating a lovely pinkish hue. Stir in the hot sauce for an
                  unexpected kick.</li>
        
                <li>Combine and Cook: Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain it
                  and return it to the pot. Pour the marshmallow-spaghetti
                  sauce over the noodles and mix well. Add the chocolate syrup
                  and continue to stir until everything is evenly
                  coated. Trust me, the chocolate syrup is the secret
                  ingredient that turns this dish from "meh" to "whoa!"</li>
        
                <li>Add the Toppings: Now it's time for the toppings!
                  Sprinkle the grated cheddar cheese over the spaghetti. Add
                  the sliced dill pickles and gummy bears. The gummy bears add
                  a chewy texture that really surprises the palate. If youâ€™re
                  feeling adventurous, crush a handful of potato chips and
                  sprinkle them on top for that extra crunch.</li>
        
                <li>Serve and Enjoy: Serve the Marshmallow Spaghetti on a
                  large plate. Make sure to garnish with a few more potato
                  chips and maybe a drizzle of chocolate syrup for
                  presentation.</li>
        
                <li>Pro Tip: For an extra special touch, pair this dish with
                  a glass of chilled orange juice. The citrus notes will cut
                  through the richness of the sauce, balancing out the flavors
                  and leaving your taste buds both confused and
                  delighted.</li>
